      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>It is my purpose to connect technology and humans by being proactive in my service, communicating effectively, and maintaining a robust operational organization. I believe that the overall aspect that creates the best environment to bring about technical excellence and user trust is where IT experiences can be dependable and accessible.</p>

      <h2>Vision & Goals</h2>
      <p>The overall idea of this work was to create a strong professional portfolio that will enable me to demonstrate my leadership readiness and technical skills within the Internet of Things (IoT) sphere, specifically, to be closer to the long-term goal of becoming an Internet of Things (IoT) Specialist. The aim was not only to demonstrate my supervisory abilities in the IT sphere, which include incident response, SLA compliance, KPI monitoring, and staff coaching, but also the readiness to supervise interconnected smart systems that need security, responsiveness, and high availability.</p>
