            <h3>Ethical Dilemma Response</h3>
            <p> Among employees, there were complaints, with engineers being the most vocal
complainants, that the advancement process was more dependent upon personal relationships
with the senior managers rather than quantifiable performance or merit.</p>

            <h3>Causal Loop Diagram</h3>
            <p>In this diagram, there is a feedback loop as Supervisor Communication increases
Team Morale, which leads to Team Performance and Output. Better performance will lower
the Escalation Rate, and Response Time will decrease along with Customer Satisfaction</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Personal Code of Ethics</h3>
            <p>A supervisor in information technology can easily establish a team of high
performers, trust, and inclusiveness by having a personal code of ethics. Integrity is the
principal key element since all the decisions must be implemented with integrity, impartiality,
and repeatability, despite individual relationships and organizational demands</p>

        <section>
            <h3>U.S. Cultural Adaptation Reflection</h3>
            <p>As I worked in India, I noticed that IT culture in this part of the world is built on a
formal manner of communication, strict hierarchies, and a centralized system of making
decisions. A contrasting pattern is applied by the U.S.</p>
